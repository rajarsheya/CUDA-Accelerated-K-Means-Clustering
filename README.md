# CUDA Accelerated K-Means Clustering

## - Arsheya Raj and Sunjil Gahatraj

This project contains an efficient implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm on the
CUDA platform. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data
clustering and pattern recognition. Our approach leverages the parallel computing capabilities of modern
GPUs to accelerate the execution of the algorithm, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. We
propose a novel data partitioning technique and parallelize the key computations of the k-means
algorithm, distance computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive
experiments on various datasets and show significant speedups compared to a CPU-based
implementation. The results indicate that our method can achieve significant speedup over the CPU,
making it a promising approach for large-scale data clustering applications.
